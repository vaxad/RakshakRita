# Rakshakrita - Empowering Citizen Voices

## Project Overview

Rakshakrita is a platform designed to empower citizens by providing them with a voice to express their opinions and concerns. It serves as a bridge between the public and law enforcement, ensuring that citizen feedback is not only heard but also acted upon. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how users can contribute.

## How It Works

Rakshakrita operates on a simple yet effective process:

1. **Access the Platform**: Users can voice their opinions by scanning the QR code, which redirects them to the official Rakshakrita website.

2. **User Registration and Anonymity**: For first-time users, a unique ID is generated to distinguish between users without compromising anonymity. The user's location is verified within a 100-meter radius of the police station to ensure local relevance.

3. **Multilingual Support**: Rakshakrita supports multiple languages, allowing users to express themselves in the language they are most comfortable with.

4. **User-Friendly Feedback Form**: The feedback form provides a user-friendly experience, offering an array of options. Users fill a mandatory field describing their problem, answer objective questions, and can use speech-to-text or attach media for more detailed feedback.

5. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Feedback elements undergo analysis through a machine learning model, categorizing descriptions as positive or negative. The results are stored in a database for authorities to review and generate reports.

6. **Additional Features**:
    - Feedback Reports: Users can view reports highlighting the public opinion on different police stations.
    - Live Heatmaps: Visual representation of the intensity of negative feedback for various localities.

7. **Periodic Reports to Higher Authorities**: Regular reports are sent to higher authorities, providing detailed insights into police stations under their jurisdictions. This aids in identifying and addressing potential issues promptly.
